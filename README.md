## 👋 Hello, I'm Ayomide Soniyi

🚀 Passionate Backend Developer | Problem-Solver | Lifelong Learner | Full stack web developer (in view)

I'm a software engineer with a background in Mathematics and a flair for building scalable backend systems. From Node.js to FastAPI, I enjoy turning complex ideas into clean, testable code. I’ve built cohort-based LMS systems, dog-matching apps, file managers, and image compressors — and I’m always up for the next challenge.
